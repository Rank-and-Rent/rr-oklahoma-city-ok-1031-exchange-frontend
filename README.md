# 1031 Exchange Oklahoma City

## Taxonomy Rationale

This site uses a self-generated taxonomy designed to support nationwide replacement property identification for 1031 exchange investors. The taxonomy prioritizes property identification services over intermediary coordination, reflecting the rank and rent model where the primary value proposition is helping investors find replacement properties across all fifty states.

Services are organized into seven categories: Timelines (45-day and 180-day deadline support), Structures (three-property, 200-percent, and 95-percent identification rules), Execution (qualified intermediary coordination, property identification, escrow management), Tax (boot calculations, basis tracking, state tax coordination), Reporting (Form 8824 preparation, documentation packages), Property Paths (multifamily, NNN retail, industrial, DST interests), and Education (exchange planning consultation, identification rules explainers). This structure ensures investors can find support for every stage of their exchange, from initial planning through tax reporting.

Property types focus on single tenant net lease retail assets suitable for 1031 exchange replacement, including convenience stores, drive-thru QSR, pharmacies, dollar stores, coffee drive-thrus, auto parts retail, hard discount grocers, ground lease outparcels, urgent care medical clinics, auto service centers, tractor supply stores, and last-mile logistics flex properties. These property types offer stable cash flow, credit tenants, and minimal management requirements that appeal to passive investors seeking replacement properties.

Locations include Oklahoma City as the primary market, surrounding suburbs and neighborhoods within 30-45 miles, plus nationwide support for investors seeking replacement properties outside Oklahoma. The location taxonomy emphasizes local market knowledge while supporting nationwide property identification, allowing investors to diversify geographically while maintaining access to local qualified intermediary relationships and closing support.
